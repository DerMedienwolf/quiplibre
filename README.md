Quiplibre
=========

This is Quiplibre, a Free Software alternative to Quiplash. It relies on the [HappyFunTimes party games system](http://greggman.github.io/HappyFunTimes).

## Structure:

    main.js         # electron's initial script.
                    # It starts happyfuntimes and
                    # opens game.html in a window

    game.html       # the game. All HTML/CSS/JavaScript are in this file
                    # for simplicity

    controller.html # the controller. This is served to player's devices
                    # when they go to happyfuntimes.net


## How do I run this thing?
1. clone this git repo, or download the zip file and extract it to where ever you want this project to live
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your computer, if it isn't already installed
3. run "npm install" on the directory (this is what RUNMEFIRSTTIME(.sh|.bat) does)
4. each time you want to run the game, run "npm start" in the directory (this is what RUNME(.sh|.bat) does)

## How do I connect controllers?
Open a browser window and go to http://happyfuntimes.net. This should connect your device to the game. Make sure your device is on the same WiFi as your computer.

NOTE: HappyFunTimes claims it will only work on home network, and is unlikely to work on corporate networks, coffee shops, airport WiFi, etc...

## So I notice this project is missing a lot of the bells and whistles of Quiplash, such as music, timers, colors, etc
Yeah, I couldn't be bothered. If you'd like to try to spruce Quiplibre up, go right ahead :)
